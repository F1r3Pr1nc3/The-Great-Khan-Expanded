 anomaly.2550.desc: "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems to have been subjected to a heavy missile barrage, but one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that power can be restored to the shipyard, but it would be a significant project.We will need time to study the structure and create new drawings"
 anomaly.2551.desc: "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has successfully restored power to the automated shipyard over [From.From.From.GetName]. The facility immediately resumed its interrupted construction order, using what materials it had on hand to build three advanced raiders of an unknown design.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. We have sent crews to the new ships and commissioned them into our fleet.We will need time to study the structure and create new drawings"

The facility immediately resumed its interrupted construction order, using what materials it had on hand to build an advanced frigate of unknown design.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. We have sent a crew to the new ship and pressed it into service with our fleet."
 anomaly.2553.desc: "Unfortunately, after the launch of an ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. \n\nBut not so bad! In the process we have been found drawings of new ships: Raiders, Frigates, Pirate Cruisers and asteroid outposts!"
