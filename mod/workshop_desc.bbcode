[h3]Prolog[/h3]
This is a continuation of [i][url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129462916]The Great Khan Expanded[/url] (2.7) by Kinneyj47[/i]. It has been completely overhauled and extended, several fixes, compatibility, +built-in [i]Crisis Manager s.b[/i]. [i][u]Note[/u]: [strike]this is still a beta,[/strike] there can probably be bugs, which are welcome to be reported.[/i]

This mod adds three new subject types to help you navigate the midgame crisis [spoiler](of course, only if the respective conditions are met)[/spoiler]:
¹ [b][i]Machinesmith[/i][/b] grant the Great Khan addition [i]technology[/i] in exchange for being left alone.
² [b][i]Fabricator[/i][/b] suffer an alloy tax, and produce [i]fleets[/i] for the Khan in exchange for being left alone.
³ [i][b]Dominion[/b] (beta)[/i] suffer a lesser mineral and energy tax, their fight along with the Great Khan in exchange for being [i]"protected"[/i].
• The Khan can now conquer [i]techs and relics[/i] [spoiler]so all of this can be passed on to successor or Satrapy empires in certain cases[/spoiler].
• Not just because of that is in result [i]the Future of the Horde[/i] more decisive/forceful.
• If the Khan is defeated by an AI ([i]NPC[/i]) his specific [i]relict[/i] is not lost [spoiler](since you may be able to get it later that way)[/spoiler].
• Furthermore, should the Great Khan manage to dominate the galaxy, they will eventually begin integrating their Satrapies, sparking a [i]galaxy wide uprising[/i], or they will declare war on a Fallen Empire, which will then awaken, starting a [i][b]War in Heaven[/b][/i].
• This mod also allows you to force the Great Khan to [i]spawn[/i] [spoiler](at any time as often or random)[/spoiler]. The [i]settings[/i] can be accessed (via partly integrated [i]Crisis Manager[/i] – "Manual Operations") through your choice of [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]Mod Menu[/url], [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458024521]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url], or the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2466607238]Infinite Core Framework & Modmenu[/url] (or if there isn't any, just look into the Edicts section)!
• After the Khan's end: Empires get claim on they former systems. [spoiler](and some kind of minor compensation for damage done - 3.2)[/spoiler]
