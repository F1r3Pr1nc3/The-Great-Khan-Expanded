**The Great Khan Expanded** is a mod for Stellaris (initiated by [Kinneyj47](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198167006924)), focusing on a better mid-game Marauder event (with all the consequences). It's also open source, so feel free to contribute! For more see the [workshop desc](/mod/workshop_description.bbcode) (_[life](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2508704523)_).

## How to contribute
Have an idea? Great! Head over to our [discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/378985949373399040/445225961722478602) to discuss it. You can also check out the issues page on [Github](../../../The-Great-Khan-Expanded/issues) and see if there is already talked about this!

### Submitting pull requests
If you aren't a member of the mod team, and want to contribute, that's awesome (and easy!). Just fork the repository (there should be a little button on the top right saying "fork"), clone it to your machine, make all the changes you want, commit and push back to GitHub.

Then, go back to our repository, click the "submit pull request" button (on the right, under the number of commits). Click "compare across forks", choose "staging" as your base (that is, where you want your changes to end up), and choose your fork as the head repository. Select the branch on your fork with your changes, and create the PR!

## Submitting bug reports
Check out the issues page on [Github](../../../The-Great-Khan-Expanded/issues) and see if we've already talked about this! If not, please submit a report! The more info you give, the faster we can solve it. Its especially helpful if you tell us what kind of mods you use.

## Installation
You can get the mod from the Steam [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2508704523).

You can also install by downloading this repository:

 - Choose the branch you want. We recommend you use the Staging branch, for the latest "stable" content.
 - Clone the branch into your local mod folder (see below), or download a zip and extract it there.
 - Rename the downloaded folder to "`TheGreatKhanExpanded`" if it is named anything else (such as "The-Great-Khan-Expanded-staging")
 - Move the "`TheGreatKhanExpanded.mod`" file from the "`TheGreatKhanExpanded`" folder out into the parent mod folder.
 - When you're finished, you should see the following paths:
   - `/mod/TheGreatKhanExpanded/README.md`
